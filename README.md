## SendMessagesAsync

No, the same message will not be sent twice in this code. The SendMessagesAsync method creates a list of messages from the variableValues parameter, and then sends all the messages in the list to the queue using await queueClient.SendAsync(messages);.

The SendAsync method is an atomic operation, which means that if an exception occurs during the operation, the entire operation is rolled back and none of the messages are sent. Therefore, there is no possibility of the same message being sent twice.

## BackgroundService vs. IHostedService
No, neither approach is inherently better than the other. Both the BackgroundService class and the IHostedService interface provide ways to run background tasks in a .NET Core application. The choice between them depends on the specific requirements of your worker service.

Inheriting from the BackgroundService class provides a higher-level abstract class for implementing background services, with some common background service functionality already implemented. This makes it easier to write and maintain a simple worker service.

On the other hand, implementing the IHostedService interface provides a lower-level interface that gives you more control over the details of the background service's implementation. This can be useful for more complex worker services that need custom logic for starting, stopping, and running tasks.

Ultimately, the choice between these two approaches depends on the specific requirements of your worker service, and both approaches are valid options for creating a worker service in .NET Core.

## host.RunAsync() or await host.Run()
Whether to use await host.RunAsync() or await host.Run() in a .NET Worker Service application depends on your specific use case.

If you want the method to block and wait for the service to complete before continuing, you should use await host.Run(). This method blocks the calling thread until the service is stopped, so it's suitable for console applications and other scenarios where you want to keep the application running until the service is finished.

On the other hand, if you want to start the service and continue with other tasks or operations in your application, you should use await host.RunAsync(). This method returns a Task object that represents the running service, so you can await it and continue with other operations while the service is running.

In general, using await host.RunAsync() is recommended for most scenarios, as it allows you to continue with other operations while the service is running. However, if you're building a console application or a similar application that needs to keep running until the service is finished, you should use await host.Run().
